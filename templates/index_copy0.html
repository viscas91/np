                   For the last 10+ years, jab bhi tumhari yaad aati thi mai humari photo dekh leta tha, isliye online backup banaya tha iska. I had fear of losing you, isliye tumhara account check karta tha. A part of me always wanted you back. Last time jo hua tha I am really sorry for that, I wish I could go back and fix things.

                    I want to tell you what happened all these years. My dad didn't let me do what I wanted to do, he is the biggest setback for me, I had no support from him, I wanted to do BCA but he didn't let me, which i regret the most. College khatam hone k baad 2 saal lag gaye meri marksheet aur degree lene mai, sab marksheet pe galat naam likha tha college waalon ne, aur saale help bhi nahi kar rahe the, saale bolte the "tumhari pehchaan hai university mai toh khud karwao", yeh 2 saal I use to run every week to university or college. Kabhi yeh document lao, kabhi yeh letter lao, sab chutiyapa. I lost so much precious time in this. Unnecessary gap create ho gaya tha, bahut jagah apply kiya tha, degree maangte the harr jagah. After getting my degree and marksheet in march 2017, I applied for further studies in Melbourne, Australia, cleared tests and college interview but at the last moment, just 1 week before college start my visa was rejected, I was upset, depressed, after trying so hard in the end it doesn't even matter. Application processing, tests, etc mai bhi bahut time laga tha. Bahut logo se help maangi thi, ek reference dedo, kahi bhi par kisi ne help nahi kiya, acchi jagah pe hain log fir bhi help nahi kiye, reference he maanga tha.

                    Time laga mujhe apne depression se bahar nikalne mai, is samay kaash tum hoti mere saath. After depression I decided to change my career to IT (web/software development). Self study karke I acquire all necessary skills to become a web developer, job kiya ek jagah 6 months but woh exploit kar raha tha toh I left. I started freelancing (on contract), got some projects, got one from US too. par ab I want to join a company as Full-Stack Developer (Expert Level post), jugad lagake I am trying for a remote job, khud se he kar raha huun, i got no support except from my mom :). At present mere portfolio mai thoda kaam bacha hai woh jaldi khatam karke i will apply for job. Dekhte hai kya hota hai.

                    Kaash tum mere bure samay mai saath hoti. Tumse guidance leta, help leta, kuch jugaad lagata. Don't get me wrong, i don't need anything, all i wanted is emotional support. I missed all of this.

                    My brain tells me my chances are slim and broken heart wants you back. Mai ek daldal mai fas gaya huun, kaise nikalunga pata nahi, khud se nikalunga. i have always been against all odds. Maine haar nahi maani hai, I will keep trying, I am an idealist...i will not give up.

                    Ek purani baat batata huun when we were in relationship, jab mai shaam ko football khelta tha, hum log khelne k baad beth k baatein kar rahe the, i was lying down and looking towards the sky, suddenly i saw a shooting star, woh phele kehte the na ki tutte taara dekhne par wish maang lete hain, I instantly made a wish "I wish to marry nisha". Us din k baad se aaj tak nahi dekha shooting star.

                    I believe god punished me for what I did to you. I apologize to you for everything, I was wrong, my thinking was clouded with anger and frustration. It's apparent that I screwed things.

                    I dont know if I should say it. I can't express myself to anyone, mom se abhi toh nahi bol sakta...dukhi ho jayengi, jo bhi mann mai tha likh diya, kuch baatein mai sirf tumse he share kar sakta huun. Yesterday night I was thinking about all this, I know my chances are slim, almost none, yesterday I cried thinking I will lose you, couldn't sleep, 2:30 am tak utha tha, puri left nose jaam ho gayi thi, now eyes are feeling tired (i don't know how to say it), while writing too automatically tears are falling, baar baar muh dhona pad raha tha.

                    Maine sab kuch bata diya tumhe because I love you, I believe be honest with one you love, ab tumhe decision lene mai aasaani hogi. Waise I know kya hoga but still i wanted you to know this.
